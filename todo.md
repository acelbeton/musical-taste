### What will the app do?
    The app will authenticate the user via their spotify account, they get to a page where they can see their musical taste, their genres, artists, songs. They can see visual charts about their tendendencies etc. The app will feed information to AI regarding the music history of the user, and will make some funky, musical taste dialysis.

### What do I need to do?
    [] Set up the app
    [] Make an authentication route and logic using Spotify API
    [] Firstly, fetch some basic data, like last 50 played songs with Spotify API
    [] Try pandas, try to calculate basic things like top genres, most frequent artists, mood profile etc.
